Women have been among the most disadvantaged and oppressed section of our country with regards to access to and control over resources. Problems faced by them continue to be grave particularly for illiterate and semi literate women of rural and urban areas. In order to alleviate their problems, Govt. of India launched a scheme entitled **Trade Related Entrepreneurship Assistance and development (TREAD)** during the 9th plan period which has been slightly modified and is now put to operation. The Scheme envisages economic empowerment of such women through trade related training, information and counseling extension activities related to trades. products, services etc.

1.  #### Objectives:

    Experience has revealed that apart from counseling and training, delivery of credit poses the most serious problem for the poor women. There is also dreath of information with regard to existing status of women and their common needs for providing necessary support. Since such women are not able to have an easy access to credit, it has been envisaged that the credit will be made available to women applicants through [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") who would be capable of handling funds in an appropriate manner. These [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") will not only handle the disbursement of such loans needed by women but would also provide them adequate counseling, training and assistance in developing markets.

2.  #### Salient features:

    1. ##### Credit
       * Under the scheme, there is a provision for Government of India grant upto 30% of the loan/credit maximum upto Rs. 30.00 lakh as appraised by lending institutions/banks. The appraising lending institutions would finance the remaining 70% as loan Assistance to applicant women, who have no easy access to credit from banks due to their cumbersome procedures and the inability of poor and usually illiterate/ semi-literate women to provide adequate security demanded by banks in the form of collaterals.
       * Government of India Grant and the loan portion from the lending agencies to assist such women shall be routed through eligible [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") engaged in assisting poor women through any kind of income generating activities in non farm sector.
       For example if an [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") submits projects for a number of individual or group(s) women say for Rs. 50,000 each for a group of 50 women, then the loan amount required by 50 women would be Rs. 25 lakhs. To it would be added the expenditure that the [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") will make in training/ counseling of staff, part expenses on operationalizing a management and monitoring system,vehicles, charges for legal documentation, training of loaners, auditors fees charged. Say duly approved by lending institutes, it works out to be Rs. 15 lakhs. Then the total project cost would be Rs. 25 + 15 lakhs. The Government of India grant would be maximum upto Rs. 12 lakhs (30% of 40 lakhs).

    2. ##### Training and Counseling
       Training organizations viz. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises(MSMEs), Entrepreneurship Development Institutes(EDIs), NISIET and the [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") conducting the training programmes for the development of women beneficiaries identified under the scheme would be provided a grant upto maximum limit of Rs. 1.00 lakh per programme provided such institutions also bring their share to the extent of minimum of 25% of the government grant. The batch size for such training activity will be atleast 20 participants. Duration of training programme will be minimum one month. For example if a mention institution or eligible [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") wants to conduct pre or post project training programme for a group of women then the maximum Government of India grant can be Rs. 1.00 lakh provided the [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization "Non-governmental organization") also raises 25% of the requested grant i.e the total expenditure can be upto Rs. 1.25 lakhs for availing full assistance of Government of India grant.

    3. ##### Eliciting Information on Related Needs
       Institutions such as Entrepreneurship Development Institutes(EDIs), [NIMSME](https://www.nimsme.org/ "National Institute for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises"), [NIESBUD](https://www.niesbud.nic.in/ "National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development"), [IIE](http://iie.nic.in/ "Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship"), MSME-DIs EDIs sponsored by State Government and any other suitable institution of repute will be provided need based Government grant primarily for undertaking activities aiming at empowerment of women such as field surveys, research studies, evaluation studies, designing of training modules, etc. covered under the scheme. The grant shall be limited upto Rs. 5 lakhs per project.
