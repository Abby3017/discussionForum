First **Indian General Election** Held from 25 Oct 1951 - 21 Feb 1952. No election is complete without political parties talk about there agenda and policy that benefit people.
So what does **MANIFESTO** means - *a public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.*

Here, I will list notable policy and few points from them that **congress** party had put for the election of 2014:

1. ##### 15 POINT AGENDA FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION

    - We will endeavour to bring around two- thirds of our population – the skilled hands that build India – into the middle class, through a package of basic rights for all workers – formal and informal, organized and unorganized, regular and contractual. Our aim will be to provide them and all low-income families with economic security and a minimum standard of living to uplift their condition. The charter of minimum socio-economic rights we will put in place includes:
        - Right to Health
        - Right to Pension
        - Right to Homestead or Housing d. Right to Social Security
        - Right to Dignity and humane working conditions
        - Right to Entrepreneurship that will protect and assist all those who seek to become entrepreneurs

    -  We will provide skills and training to 10 crore youth and provide them with employment opportunities over the next 5 years.
