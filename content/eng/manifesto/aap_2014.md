**Manifesto** - What does manifesto represent. _Manifesto is a public statement of someone's policies, views and intention do something which political parties put in front of people before elections._

Why do **Political Parities Need Manifesto** - _Manifesto functions as both a statement of a principles and a bold, sometimes
rebellious call to action. By causing people to evaluate the gap between those principles and their current reality, the manifesto challenges assumptions, fosters commitment, and provokes change._

Here, I will list down notable points **Aam Aadmi Party** had put in front of people before 2014 General Elections:

1.  #### BRINGING AN END TO CORRUPTION:

    1. **JAN LOKPAL BILL** - The Jan Lokpal was conceived as an independent empowered and accountable Ombudsman which could independently,credibly and expeditiously investigate corruption offenses of all public servants. The provisions of this bill include:

       - All public officials(including Prime Minister, Union Ministers, MPs) of the Union Government shall fall under the preview of the investigation of the Lokpal.
       - Any public official found guilty of corruption would be removed from their position and sentenced to prison. Their property will be confiscated.
       - Time bound investigation and trial will be introduced in cases of corruption.
       - The Lokpal will have power to initiate investigations and prosecution against those charged with corruption.

    2. **Swaraj Bill** - Aam Aadmi Party would legislate the Swaraj Bill which would devolve power to Gram Sabhas and Mohalla Sabhas, and thereby curb corruption at the local level.
    3. We will simplify all complex government procedures which provide opportunities to corruption.
    4. We will promote the use to information technology to promote transparency and reduce corruption.

2.  #### PROVIDING SWIFT, ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE TO THE COMMON MAN:

    Aam Aadmi Party is firmly committed to ensuring that a common citizen has access to a quick, fair, affordable and accountable justice system. Towards this end AAP will ensure:

    1.  Institute adequate number of **Gram Nyayalayas** which will consist of simple procedures. AAP is committed to ensuring that these will take cares of petty cases that affect common people in a speedy manner.

3.  #### GENDER JUSTICE:

    We envision a world in which women will be acknowledged and treated as equal citizens in their own right; where they will not be governed by male-dominated values which determine their societal and familial roles. We can truly call ourselves a democratic, modern and progressive nation when we truly advance and deliever on women's rights, freedom, security, equality and empowerment. Towards this:

    1. Implement comprehensive and long-term public education pro-grammes to end the culture of gender-based discrimination and violence.
