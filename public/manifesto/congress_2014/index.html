<p>First <strong>Indian General Election</strong> Held from 25 Oct 1951 - 21 Feb 1952. No election is complete without political parties talk about there agenda and policy that benefit people.
So what does <strong>MANIFESTO</strong> means - <em>a public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.</em></p>

<p>Here, I will list notable policy and few points that <strong>congress</strong> party had put for the election of 2014:</p>

<ol>
<li><h5 id="15-point-agenda-for-socio-economic-and-political-transformation">15 POINT AGENDA FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION</h5>

<ol>
<li>We will endeavour to bring around two- thirds of our population – the skilled hands that build India – into the middle class, through a package of basic rights for all workers – formal and informal, organized and unorganized, regular and contractual. Our aim will be to provide them and all low-income families with economic security and a minimum standard of living to uplift their condition. The charter of minimum socio-economic rights we will put in place includes:

<ul>
<li>Right to Health</li>
<li>Right to Pension</li>
<li>Right to Homestead or Housing d. Right to Social Security</li>
<li>Right to Dignity and humane working conditions</li>
<li>Right to Entrepreneurship that will protect and assist all those who seek to become entrepreneurs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We will provide skills and training to 10 crore youth and provide them with employment opportunities over the next 5 years.</li>
<li>The protection of minorities is at the core of the ethos of our country. The Communal Violence Bill, which was drafted and introduced     by the Indian National Congress,remains an important commitment. We will work towards its enactment at the earliest.</li>
<li>Continuing our record of delivering India’s highest growth rates, we will restore India to 8% plus growth rate within 3 years:

<ul>
<li>We will continue to take firm action to control inflation even in a difficult global economic scenario.</li>
<li>Our vision is building India as the world leader in manufacturing. We will ensure a 10% growth rate in the manufacturing sector   with a special emphasis on small and medium enterprises.</li>
<li>We will introduce the Goods and Services Tax Bills and a new Direct Tax Code Bill in Parliament and ensure they are enacted within one year.</li>
<li>We will invest more than 1 trillion dollars over the next decade on upgrading India’s power, transport and other development  infrastructure. We will support more transparent, competitive and better-regulated Public Private Partnerships for both hard and soft infrastructure development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Indian National Congress believes modernisation of our defence forces is imperative. The Indian National Congress shall ensure that the process of procuring the finest, and most state-of-the-art equipment is carried out ef efficiently and transparently, while ensuring rapid development of our domestic defence industry. We will continue to protect and advance the interests of our defence personnel and ex-servicemen. We will continue to follow an unwavering pro- India foreign policy, enhance bilateral relationships with our neighbours and friendly nations, enhance commercial ties and strive to mobilize support for permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="protecting-the-interests-of-labour">PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF LABOUR</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Indian National Congress will ensure health insurance as well as pension cover for this group</li>
<li>The Indian National Congress is committed to the strictest implementation of Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act of 1970, to end exploitation of workers and to improve their welfare and working conditions.</li>
<li>Aadhaar is a powerful tool for protecting the interests of migrant labour,as well as ensuring the smooth  ow of remittances to their families. All migrant labour will be covered under the Aadhaar programme in the next one year, through a special campaign.</li>
<li>The Unorganised Worker&rsquo;s Social Security Act, 2008 has been enacted; this will be implemented in letter and spirit.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="women-s-empowerment-and-protection-of-children">Women’s empowerment and protection of Children</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Indian National Congress will ensure that all laws for the welfare of children including the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, will be strictly enforced.</li>
<li>The quality of the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) programme will be vastly improved and special incentives will be given to Anganwadi workers.</li>
<li>The Indian National Congress is committed to the enactment of the Women’s Reservation Bill to reserve 33 % of all seats in the Lok Sabha, and in all State legislative assemblies for women.</li>
<li>Fast-Track Courts will be established with ‘in-camera’ proceedings facilities in State headquarters and in regional centres. The purpose of these Courts will be solely to address crimes against women. Mandatory procedure for the rapid conclusion of cases where custody of children is involved shall be put in place.</li>
<li>The Indian National Congress will earmark at least 30% of all funds  owing into Panchayats and Nagarpalikas for development of women and children and focus on the special needs of female agricultural labour and women cultivators.</li>
<li>We will encourage the setting up of “Poorn Shakti Kendras” at block level to provide a single window mechanism for awareness, information, access and utilisation of government schemes and programmes.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="youth-and-student-agenda">YOUTH AND STUDENT AGENDA</h4>

<ol>
<li>We will enhance focus and resources on the implementation of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, to improve quality of secondary education. We will achieve near universal enrolment in secondary education.</li>
<li>The Indian National Congress will place a special emphasis on reducing the drop-out rate particularly in middle and secondary levels.</li>
<li>We will establish an independent regulatory mechanism to oversee State and private institutions to ensure standardisation and quality of education.</li>
<li>We are committed to the cause of special education. We will strengthen facilities for children with special needs and disabilities. We will also award priority to develop infrastructure for differently-abled persons.</li>
<li>To focus on higher education, we launched the Rashtriya Uchhatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) to provide strategic funding to improve college and university infrastructure. RUSA will help create 70 new universities, provide infrastructure in current universities, upgrade autonomous colleges to Universities, and create a new model of general degree colleges and professional institutions.</li>
<li>The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan launched by the Congress-led UPA government will be implemented to ensure high quality sporting facilities in every block of the country.</li>
<li>The National Service Scheme, launched by the Congress-led UPA government for graduates, aims to enhance IT literacy, financial literacy, english communication and other soft skills; to make the youth more employable. The Indian National Congress is committed to increasing funding and reach of this Scheme while prioritising its implementation.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="urban-development">URBAN DEVELOPMENT</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Indian National Congress will ensure that Mayors and Municipal Chairpersons have fully functional powers, so that they can operate as Chief Executives Officers of cities with executive powers and responsibilities and not just ceremonial positions. We will also increase the tenure of Mayors.</li>
<li>Urban constituencies are rapidly growing in population and the disparity between constituencies is increasing. This undermines the principle of equality of vote and also results in under-franchise of urban areas. We will ensure this issue is revisited so that constituencies can be adjusted to re ect population changes.</li>
<li>JNNURM was a landmark initiative undertaken by the Congress-led government; it puts the urban agenda centrestage with major investments in urban infrastructure. We also launched a revamped JNNURM-II with more funding and more powers to local governments. JNNURM-II is giving priority to the strengthening of human and institutional capabilities, local planning and improvement in governance. We will continue to implement this with vigour and focus to ensure better sewage facilities, roads and multi-modal public transport.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="fighting-corruption">FIGHTING CORRUPTION</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill, 2011 has the potential to be the second RTI. We will ensure its passage. Redressal of public grievances at the grassroots level within a specified period of time is necessary to ensure good governance.</li>
<li>Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and Officials of Public International Organizations Bill 2011 to criminalise bribes offered by foreign officials and organisations.</li>
<li>The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, which enlarges the definition of taking a bribe and covering commercial organizations.</li>
<li>The Public Procurement Bill, 2012 regulates public procurement by all Ministries and Departments of the Central government, Central Public Sector Enterprises and bodies controlled by the Central government to ensure transparency, and fair and equitable treatment of bidders. This will promote competition and enhance efficiency in procurement processes.
<br /></li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="defence-and-welfare-of-ex-servicemen">DEFENCE AND WELFARE OF EX-SERVICEMEN</h4>

<ol>
<li>The continued and rapid modernisation of our Defence Forces is imperative. The Indian National Congress shall ensure that this process of procuring the  nest state-of-the-art equipment is carried out in an atmosphere of efficiency and full transparency.</li>
<li>India has emerged as one of the world’s largest importers of defence equipment; it is thus imperative to encourage indigenous manufacturing in every way. This will also generate substantial employment. To this end, we shall work towards giving a fresh impetus to upgrading our existing manufacturing capabilities while creating new avenues for expanding military capability.</li>
<li>The Indian National Congress has always given the highest priority to the welfare of Ex-Servicemen and their families. One of the  rst achievements of the  rst Indian National Congress-led UPA government was the creation of the Department of Ex-Servicemen&rsquo;s Welfare. In pursuance of our continued commitment, the Indian National Congress led UPA-II has now fulfilled the long-standing demand of One Rank-One Pension, a key campaign promise of the Indian National Congress in 2009. This will bring tremendous relief to the families of Ex-Servicemen.</li>
<li>A “National Commission for Ex-Servicemen” will be established to provide a further impetus to programmes designed for the welfare of their families and expand opportunities for them in Nation building and other productive activities.</li>
<li>On the strategic front India will maintain a credible deterrence and second strike capability. We shall continue the missile programme to meet potential threats in the region.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>These were the promises that INC made in election 2014.</p>
