<p><strong>Congress</strong> was the first political party that released manifesto before <em>General Election of 2019</em>. This election will happen in 7 phases from 11 April to 19 May.
Now lets dive into the manifesto of congress, let&rsquo;s see what it is offering to the public :-</p>

<ol>
<li><h4 id="industry-job">INDUSTRY &amp; JOB</h4>

<ol>
<li>All of the <em>4 lakh vacancies as on 1 April 2019 in the Central Government, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Judiciary and Parliament</em> will be filled before the end of March 2020. As a condition for devolution of funds to the healthcare and education sectors and to Panchayats and Municipalities, Congress will request State Governments to fill all vacancies, estimated at 20 lakh, in the 2 sectors and in local bodies.</li>
<li>We will work with State Governments to create new Seva Mitra positions (estimated at 10 lakh) in every Gram Panchayat and every Urban Local Body to ensure the effective delivery of government services to citizens.</li>
<li>Application fees for government examinations and government posts will be abolished.</li>
<li>We will create an Enterprise Support Agency to help entrepreneurs, including start-ups, with all-round business support including counselling, incubation, access to technology, funding, domestic and export markets, and the creation of new products, services and intellectual property.</li>
<li>Congress promises to increase the share of India’s manufacturing sector from the <em>current level of 16 per cent of GDP to 25 per cent within a period of 5 years</em> and to make India a manufacturing hub for the world. Congress believes that anything that can be made in another country can be made in India. Congress promises that it will adopt policies, formulate rules, levy taxes and reward entrepreneurship that will make India a renowned centre of manufacturing.</li>
<li>Congress will announce a <strong>Make for the World</strong> policy under which foreign and Indian companies will be invited to invest in <strong>Exclusive Export-only Zones</strong>, manufacture and export their entire production, pay no indirect taxes and pay a low rate of corporate tax.
<br /></li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="minimum-income-support-programme-misp">MINIMUM INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAMME (MISP)</h4>

<ol>
<li>The target population will be <em>5 crore families who constitute the poorest 20 per cent of all families</em>. They will be the beneficiaries of MISP. Each family will be guaranteed a cash transfer of <strong>Rs.72,000 a year</strong>.</li>
<li>There will a Design phase (3 months) followed by a Pilot and Testing phase (6–9 months) 03. before roll-out.

<ol>
<li>The estimated cost will <em>be &lt;1 per cent of GDP in Year 1 and &lt;2 per cent of GDP in Year 2</em> and thereafter.</li>
<li>As the nominal GDP grows and families move out of poverty, the cost will decline as a proportion of GDP.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Congress will appoint an independent panel of eminent economists, social scientists and statisticians to oversee the design, testing, rollout and implementation of the programme. The programme will move from one stage to the other only after a ‘go ahead’ from the panel. Congress intends to implement MISP as a joint scheme of the Central and State Governments. The scheme will be funded through new revenues and rationalisation of expenditure. Current merit subsidy schemes that are intended to achieve specific objectives will be continued.</li>
<li>The Congress goal is that <strong>No Indian Family Shall Be Left Behind</strong>.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="taxation-tax-reforms">TAXATION &amp; TAX REFORMS</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress promises to enact <strong>the Direct Taxes Code</strong> in the first year of our government. It will usher in an era of simplicity, transparency, tax equity, easy compliance and impartial administration.</li>
<li>Congress promises that the Direct Taxes Code will levy taxes at <em>reasonable and progressive rates</em> having regard to the level of current incomes, income inequalities and the principles of tax equity.</li>
<li>The GST 2.0 regime will be based on a single, moderate, standard rate of tax on all goods and services. The rate will be revenue neutral to the current indirect tax revenues of the Central and State Governments and will take note of the potential of GST 2.0 to boost their tax revenues.</li>
<li>Congress promises that Real Estate (all sectors), Petroleum Products, Tobacco and Liquor will be brought within the ambit of GST 2.0 in a manner and time period not exceeding 2 years agreed to in the GST Council.</li>
<li>Congress will endeavor to allocate a share of GST revenues to Panchayats and Municipalities.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="national-internal-security">NATIONAL &amp; INTERNAL SECURITY</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress will reverse the trend of declining defence spending under the NDA government, and will ensure that defence spending is increased to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces. We will expedite all modernisation programmes of the armed forces in a transparent manner.</li>
<li>Congress will establish the <strong>office of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)</strong> to be the principal adviser to the Government on matters relating to defence.</li>
<li>The key to internal security is intelligence, analysis and quick response. Congress had put in place the Multi-Agency Centre and the NSG regional hubs. Congress had also proposed to establish the National Counter-Terrorism Centre and NATGRID. Congress promises that NCTC will be set up within 3 months and NATGRID will be made operational by December 2019.</li>
<li>Congress will work with State Governments to increase the strength of State police forces, fill all vacancies, equip and train them, and deploy them impartially to maintain law and order and to detect and punish violators and instigators.</li>
<li>The most serious threats to internal security emanate from (1) terrorism, (2) infiltration of militants, (3) Maoism or Naxalism and (4) caste or communal violence. Congress believes that each of these threats deserves a separate and distinct response.

<ol>
<li>We promise an uncompromising approach and hard measures to put an end to terrorism and to the infiltration of militants.</li>
<li>In the case of Maoism, the Congress will resolutely fight violent activities. At the same time, Congress will address developmental challenges in the areas concerned, enlist the support of the people and win over the Maoist cadres.</li>
<li>In the case of caste or communal violence, Congress will put down such violence with a firm hand using the police forces at its command, apprehend the instigators and bring them to justice. There will be no room for self-appointed vigilante groups and moral policing brigades.
<br /></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="tourism-art-culture-heritage">TOURISM &amp; ART, CULTURE, HERITAGE</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress is committed to protecting the rich diversity of India’s art and culture and to ensuring it flourishes in an atmosphere of freedom and creativity. We will resolutely oppose censorship as well as any attempt to denigrate the art and culture of any group.</li>
<li>Congress will guarantee artistic freedom. Artists and craftsmen will enjoy the freedom to express their views in any form without fear of censorship or retribution. Attempts by vigilante groups to censor or intimidate artists will be viewed seriously and action against them will be taken according to the law.</li>

<li>Congress will work with State Governments to create young volunteer groups to guide and assist visitors at important places of tourist interest.</li>
<li>Visa-on-Arrival Scheme will be expanded to include more countries and more categories of visitors. No fee will be charged for tourist visas for a period of 3 years.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="anti-corruption-governance-transparency-accountability">ANTI-CORRUPTION &amp; GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress will also investigate the circumstances under which a number of scamsters were allowed to leave the country and will take determined steps to bring them back and face legal proceedings.</li>
<li>In order to make governance more transparent, result-oriented and accountable, Congress promises to place before the people, annually, a statement on the implementation of manifesto promises.</li>
<li>We will ensure that Social Audits of the programmes taken up for implementation are conducted and placed before the people, at the end of every year, with a report card on achievements and what remains to be done.</li>
<li>Congress will re-introduce and pass the Grievance Redressal Bill, 2011 to provide for mandatory, time-bound grievance redressal.</li>
<li>Rules under the Whistle-Blowers Protection Act, 2014 will be made to operationalise the Act. Congress promises to ensure that the law is not weakened or diluted.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="women-s-empowerment-gender-justice">WOMEN&rsquo;S EMPOWERMENT &amp; GENDER JUSTICE</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of 33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 will be enforced effectively. We will review all laws that stipulate wage rates to provide that men and women are paid the same wage for similar work.</li>
<li>We will repeal any provision of law that prohibits night shifts for women.</li>
<li>Sufficient night shelters will be built for migrant women workers. Adequate number of safe and hygienic public toilets for women will be provided in towns and cities. Sanitary napkin vending machines will be installed in public spaces, schools and colleges.</li>
<li>Congress pioneered the women’s self-help group (SHG) movement that today boasts of 87 lakh groups. Congress also launched the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM – Aajeevika). We promise to launch NRLM-2 to make SHGs a key instrument for the economic empowerment of women, to increase livelihood opportunities and to usher in transformative social change.</li>
<li>Congress promises to launch a programme to appoint an Adhikar Maitri in every Panchayat to serve as a paralegal to educate women on, and assist them in the enforcement of, their legal rights.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4 id="healthcare-education">HEALTHCARE &amp; EDUCATION</h4>

<ol>
<li>Congress promises that the total government expenditure on healthcare will be <strong>doubled to 3 per cent of GDP</strong> by the year 2023-24. The Annual Budgets will indicate the step up in each year in order to achieve the target in 2023-24.</li>
<li>Congress promises to enact the <strong>Right to Healthcare Act</strong> that will guarantee to every citizen the right to healthcare services, including free diagnostics, out-patient care, medicines and hospitalisation through a network of public hospitals and enlisted private hospitals.</li>
<li>We will <strong>implement the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010</strong> to bring accountability to the functioning of private and public clinical establishments.</li>
<li>We will promote AYUSH, the Indian systems of medicine, in the provision of healthcare services and especially in preventive healthcare.</li>
<li>Congress promises that <strong>school education from Class I to Class XII in public schools shall be compulsory and free</strong>. Suitable amendments will be made in the Right to Education Act, 2009. We will end the practice of charging special fees for different purposes in public schools.</li>
<li>We are deeply concerned about the quality of education and poor learning outcomes as reported in the Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER). Congress promises to attach the highest importance to learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Congress promises to <strong>double the allocation for Education to 6 per cent of GDP in the 5 years ending 2023-24</strong>. A path forward will be laid down in the regular Budget for 2019-20 and specific annual targets will be set.</li>
<li>We will revive, redesign and expand the Education Loan programme. Applications will be received, examined and sanctioned on a single portal and then assigned to the branch of a bank located near the applicant’s residence or place of study for documentation and monitoring. No interest will be charged during the period of study and until the student finds a job or earns through self-employment. Outstanding interest dues on old education loans as on 31 March 2019 will be waived.</li>
