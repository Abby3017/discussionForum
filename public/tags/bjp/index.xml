      <description>So what does MANIFESTO means - A public declaration of intent, policies, aims, beliefs etc, as issued by the political parties before the election.
Why do Political Parities Need Manifesto - Manifesto functions as both a statement of a principles and a bold, sometimes rebellious call to action. By causing people to evaluate the gap between those principles and their current reality, the manifesto challenges assumptions, fosters commitment, and provokes change.</description>
