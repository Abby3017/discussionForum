      <description>This ‘site-name’ is an initiative to educate people about the government policies that has an effect on their day to day life. We are not affiliated and are not part of any kind of political group or party.
Our goal: We want to spread awareness among people as, currently there is no platform where people can get needed information about the government policies in an easy or articulate way. We are providing a healthy platform where people can voice their opinions and engage in active debates about the government policies.</description>
